## The motivation for this project stemmed from my curiosity during my studies in <em>Game development with Unity</em> in college. I noticed that most AAA studios develop their own engines, which piqued my interest in the inner workings of these systems. This curiosity about what happens behind the scenes, why'd they use a custom engine but not regular one, similar to my interest in backend development for web applications. This led me to undertake the challenge of writing a game engine from scratch. I also want to understand how game engines operate and to deepen my knowledge of system and graphics programming.
